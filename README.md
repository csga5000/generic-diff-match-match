## Generic Diff Match Patch

Allows diffing of any "symbols" which could be characers, words, lines, or anything else (ex a list of rgb colors).  You can make patches for anything you can write a serializer and deserializer for.

## Problems

If you have some issues feel free to delve into my code and make alterations.  If they're good changes, please do make a merge request!  If you have an issue you may also report it here, I may address it, but likely only if it affects my projects using this code.  Otherwise, it's up to the community - either you or someone else can try to tackle it.
